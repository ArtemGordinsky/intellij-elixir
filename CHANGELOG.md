* [#862](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/862) - Wrap call definitions with name `nil` as `unquote(:nil)` in the decompiler. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

## v6.3.0

### Enhancements
* [#854](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/854) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * `credo` external annotator
    * Once modifications have settled on a file and all internal annotators have run, `mix credo` will be run on any modified file.
      * Each check failure reported by `mix credo` will be turned into a warning annotation (yellow highlight) of the line or line and column credo identified.
      * If you hover over the annotation (either in the source or on right gutter), the `mix credo PATH:LINE(:COLUMN)` explanation will be shown.  Links in the tooltip are clickable and allow you to jump to the specific line or line and column of the failure.
* [#856](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/856) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Explain Rich vs Small IDEs more
  * Add feature support table for Rich vs Small IDEs with links to alternatives for Rich IDEs features not in Small IDEs.
  * Reorder Project subsections based on usage.

### Bug Fixes
* [#854](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/854) - Rename package with typo `org.elixir_lang.annonator` -> `org.elixir_lang.annotator`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

  * Change error to say mix, elixir, or erlang path is not set instead of just mix path.
  * Rewrite of `MixRunningStateUtil#setElixir` to support calling `erl` directly in IntelliJ IDEA added a check that sdk type was the Elixir SDK Type, but there was no `else` clauses to handle that there IS an SDK, but its NOT Elixir, which is the common case on all Small IDEs (like Rubymine).  To fill this gap, if the SDK is not Elixir and a Small IDE is detected, then the SDK Home from Preferences > Other Settings > Elixir External Tools > Elixir SDK > Path will be used to get the absolute path to the `elixir` (or `elixir.bat` executable and set it in the `GeneralCommandLine`.
* [#856](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/856) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Add missing `**` for bold.
  * Document alternative setup in Small IDEs
  * Put Import from external model first in Project subsections, so that people are more likely to import as a mix project correctly.

## v6.2.0

### Enhancements
* [#817](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/817) - * Add note to README that atom module names should be prefixed with `:` - [@merqlove](https://github.com/merglove)
* [#827](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/827) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Elixir SDK will now have an Internal Erlang SDK, which can be supplied one of two ways:
    1. If `intellij-erlang` is installed: its Erlang SDK can be used
    2. Otherwise: the Erlang SDK for Elixir SDK from this plugin can be used

    Either Internal Erlang SDK's home path is used to locate the `erl` (or `erl.exe` on Windows) executable and it is used to run Elixir; bypassing the `elixir` (or `elixir.bat` on Windows) script.  Instead, as was done in #789, the ebin directories for the Elixir SDK are passed as `-pa` options to `erl`.

    The Elixir SDK's configuration becomes more important: the classpath entries are now the list of `ebin` directories to pass to `erl` using `-pa` instead of scanning for ebins in the homepath, so additional code paths can be added to the Classpaths configuration and they will be used when running `mix` and `mix test`.  The classpaths will be initialized to the ebin directories under the home path.

    * To support migrating from earlier version of the plugin, an SDK will be updated when it is used for Mix ExUnit Run Configurations
      * The default Internal Erlang SDK will be set, which uses the latest version of Erlang that can be found on the system.  When `intellij-erlang` is installed, `intellij-elixir`'s Erlang version suggestion is still used because `intellij-elixir` favors the latest version while `intellij-erlang` favors the first found, which is usually the oldest version.
      * Update roots (class path, source paths, documentation paths):
        * Class path of `HOMEPATH/lib` is replaced with `HOMEPATH/lib/APP/ebin`.
        * Source path of `HOMEPATH/lib` is replaced with `HOMEPATH/lib/APP/lib` IF it exists (so only for source SDKs)
        * Documentation of `http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/` will be replaced with `https://hexdoc.pm/APP/VERSION` for every `APP` in `HOMEPATH/lib`.
* [#839](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/839) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * All `ebin` paths in the Internal Erlang SDK will be copied to the Elixir SDK, so that they are indexed, which makes the Internal Erlang SDK modules show up in Symbol search.
  * Erlang SDK modules can be completed and then functions in those modules can be completed after typing `.`.
    * Atoms have References.
      * Indexed atoms (from decompiled Erlang `.beams` from the Internal Erlang SDK) will be used for completing atoms as soon the atom is parseable: either after the first letter `:` or inside the quotes when making a quoted atom.
      * Atoms will resolve to modules if the atom is a module name.  If the atom is quoted and contains interpolation, it will treat each interpolation as `.*` and look for regex matches to this derived potential atom name.
  * Completions for functions after `.` will now work at the end of file.  Previously, completions only worked in the middle of a file, where the `.` could parse the next work an existing call, now if that parse doesn't work and the only thing after is a new line, it will still complete.
* [#830](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/830) - Auto test for mix test case runner will automatically run tests after a change is detected in the project files, which normally happens on save, which happens when losing focus on a changed editor tab by default. - [@nivanson](https://github.com/nivanson)
* [#840](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/840) - Regression test for [#821](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/821) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#841](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/841) - Regression test for [#803](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/803) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#842](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/842) - Regression test for [#833](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/833) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#843](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/843) - Port [elixir-lang/elixir#2774](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/2774): Allow `A-Z` as sigil modifiers in addition to `a-z` to support `U` ungreedy modifier that replaced `r` ungreedy modifier for regexes. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

### Bug Fixes
* [#816](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/816) - Add notice for debug blacklist that it uses atoms, not Aliases, so you need to qualifier module aliases with `Elixir.` - [@merqlove](https://github.com/merqlove)
* [#817](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/817) - Support atoms (prefixed with `:`) and`Elixir.` and plain Aliases for debugger blacklist. - [@merqlove](https://github.com/merglove)
* [#832](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/832) - Add space to import window text - [@kentongray](https://github.com/kentongray)
* [#840](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/840) - Add `END` to allowed `keywordKey` tokens - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#841](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/841) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Only use "Macros" as first header in decompiled `.beam` files if `macro` is `defmacro`.  "Macros" header was being printed when there was only functions because the check when there was no `lastMacroNameArity` didn't care what the current `macroNameArity.macro` was.
  * When an `.erl` file has `-compile([compressed])`, it will be compiled normally, and then gzipped, so that the `.beam` will not contain the BEAM magic number `FOR1`, but instead the gzip magic number `0x1f` `0x8b`.  So, to properly handle normal and compressed, the decompiler needs to look-ahead 2-bytes and check the gzip magic number.  If the gzip magic number is detected, the InputStream will be passed through `GZIPInputStream` before the the normal decoding process.
* [#842](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/842) - When decompiling function and macro names from Erlang module, its possible for the name to contain `#` and they would be interpreted as comments.  Accepting those names in `Unquoted` wouldn't escape the `#` from being treated as a comment, so in addition to `unquote`ing the name, surround it in double quotes. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#848](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/848) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * `AdditionalDataConfigurable` only copied the the Internal Erlang SDK Code Paths when the selection in the `ComboBox` was changed, which meant if the there was only one Erlang SDK or the user never changed the selection, the Code Paths were never copied.  To get the Code Paths copied when the Elixir SDK is first created and `setupSdkPaths` interface method is called
    1. All paths are set directly on the Elixir SDK as before
    2. The default Erlang SDK, which should be the one that was last created, is configured in `SdkAdditionalaData`
    3. The Code paths from the Erlang SDK are copied to the Elixir SDK
        1. If the the Erlang SDK is from intellij-elixir and does not have `ebin` directories for its Class Paths, then the Class Paths is expanded to Code Paths.
* [#851](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/851) - The Code Paths from the Internal Erlang SDK were not being copied from the default Erlang SDK to the Elixir SDK when the default Erlang SDK was set during `mix test` runs, which meant that the Elixir SDK would not upgrade correctly from 6.1.1 to 6.2.0 without the user deleting the Elixir SDK and recreating it. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

## v6.1.1

### Bug Fixes
* [#795](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/795) - When [#754](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/794) made `intellij-erlang` a soft-dependency, it broke the debugger's icons that referenced `ErlangIcons`, but it turns out all the icon constants were aliases to `AllIcons.Debugger` constants, so by using the `AllIcons.Debugger` icons directly, the dependency on `ErlangIcons` can be removed without the need to copy the image files into `intellij-elixir`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#796](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/796) - When `do ... end` template is inserted, it did not have a previous child whose attributes to use, so it used the default, which left the cursor unindented.  To get the cursor indented by default, When the `ElementType` is `DO`, apply the `stabChildrenIndent` rules: indent normal and determine whether to indent relative to direct parent using code style setting. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#797](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/797) - Include `VirtualFile` path in Beam read errors - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

## v6.1.0

### Enhancements
* [#792](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/792) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Since the process of requiring resource files is the same, `org.elixir_lang.ElixirModules` has static methods for copying resources out to a temporary directory and adding the `-r <temporary_path>` for one or more resource files to a new or existing ParametersList.  These are now shared for the Mix ExUnit and Debugger code paths.
  * Format class
    * `ElixirXDebugProcess`
    * `MixExUnitRunningState`
    * `MIxRunningState`

### Bug Fixes
* [#792](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/792) - The compiled `.beam` files were removed in 58e7d4a, which was before v5.1.0, but not all users had problems with using the debugger.  [#739](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/739) [persisted](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/739#issuecomment-322032123) (as reported by [@erikreedstrom](https://github.com/erikreedstrom)) when 6.0.0 was released; I retried reproducing on a clean VM and I got it.  I'm not sure why it worked for some people in prior releases since the `.beam` don't exist that were being copied, but now the debugger uses the same system of copying `.ex` files and requiring them with `-r` instead of copying `.beam` and using `-pa` to add the `ebin` directory.  Fix was verified local under macOS and in Windows VM that reproduced [#739](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/739). - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

## v6.0.0

### Enhancements
* [#724](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/724) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Code Formatter
    * `do` block lines are indented

    * Comments in `spec` (that is above operands to `|` align with the operands
    * Remove newlines from pipelines, so that all pipelines start with an initial value or call and each `|>` is the start of a successive line.
    * Key exclusivity: if an association operation or keyword key is already on a line, the container value automatically has it's elements wrapped if there is nested associations or keyword pairs, so that two levels of keys are not on the same line.

    * Always match on `%__MODULE__{}` for state in clauses to prevent state update errors
    * Match on `:suite_finished` and `:suite_started` events, so that only events added to the interface will be unknown and `IO.warn` can be used tell anyone spotting the new event to file an issue.
* [#741](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/741) - Instead of pinning position (`1` for lines or `3` for heredocs), `pin` `*_PROMOTER` token, so it's more obvious the pattern is that the promoter is pinned. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

### Bug Fixes

  * Treat `::` the same as `:`  in `key:` after `when` in type specifications as it's a realistic error.
  * Change `.` to `#` when referring to constants in javadocs
  * Remove `@param` without descriptions
  * Remove explicit type from generics when the type can be inferred.
  * Check if `atNonNumericOperation` reference is non-`null` before resolving
  * Swap empty branches to inverted conditions for final `else`.
  * Check if `Type` `leftOperand` is `null` before using it.
  * Remove empty `highlightTypesAndTypeParameterUsages(When...)`
  * Remove unused `highlightTypesAndSpecificationTypeParameterDeclarations`
  * Flip `equals` to eliminate need for `null` check
  * Remove redundant type arguments (`<...>`)
  * Change `Collections.EMPTY_SET` to `Collections.emptySet()` to prevent uncheck cast warnings.
  * Inline constant argument for errors.
  * Check if `when` `rightOperand` is non-`null` before scanning it for parameter names.
  * Fix typos

  * When compilation error is detected during `mix test`, it will be turned into a test failure.
    * Compilation errors are any stacktraces to `stderr` that end in `    (elixir) lib/kernel/parallel_require.ex:`.
    * The test failure for the compilation will be attributed to either `mix test` or the inferred module name of test file.
      * If the first line of the stacktrace contains `test/.*_test.exs:\d+: \(module\)`
        * The file and line from that line will be used as the location of failure
        * The `test/` and `.exs` will be stripped from the file and it will be camelized to produce the derived test module name of the failure
      * Otherwise, `mix test` is used
  * Rearrange doc test names to emphasize the function being tested: `"test doc at MODULE.FUNCTION/ARITY (COUNT)"` becomes `"MODULE.FUNCTION/ARITY doc (COUNT)"`
    * If `MODULE` is the same as the test case without the `Test` suffix, then `MODULE.` is stripped too and the test name becomes only `FUNCTION/ARITY doc (COUNT)`
  * Fix parallel test cases nesting under each other due to asynchronous reporting from formatter.  `##teamCity` `testSuiteStarted` messages automatically nest, so switched to using `nodeId` and `parentNodeId` system, so that nesting is explicit.  This will allow multiple parallel tests to show up in GUI too.
  * `Elixir.` prefix is stripped from test case names.

  * Merge `Callable` and `Kernel` annotators
  * Use `PsiElementVisitor` instead of `PsiRecursiveElementVisitor`, so that macros in `defmodule` block don't get double annotated.
  * Instead of erasing and then applying multiple `TextAttributeKey`, erase as before, but then merge the `TextAttributeKey`'s `TextAttributes` and apply as single `setEnforcedTextAttributes`.  For some reason, this fixes the inconsistency of whether `PREDEFINED_CALL` or `MACRO_CALL` is applied first.
  * In case of multiple `resolved`s, make those that need `PREDEFINED_CALL` to win.

  * `FileReferenceFilter`
    * Add `.exs` to pattern for stacktrace linking.
    * Highlight only stacktrace path and line umber instead of entire line
    * Better path match in stacktraces
      * Only accept VirtualFile if it has a suffix matching the stacktrace's path instead of accepting the first index file with a matching basename.
      * Allow multiple VirtualFiles to be linked if it turns out there is a true file path collision between two OTP apps in the Project or Libraries.

    The `|` is inside group that is then `{3}`'d, so it allows either `'` or `"` in groups of three.  This is only applies to the sigils.  It's correct for normal string and charlist heredocs:

    * The plugin can now be published with `./gradlew publishPlugin`, *BUT* you'll need to fill in `publish*` properties in `gradle.properties`.  This will _eventually_ allow for automated "nightlies" from successful Travis-CI builds on `master`.
* [#638](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/638) - The `Callable` annotator is meant for variables, parameters, and macro and function calls and declarations.  The `ModuleAttribute` annotator handles module attribute declaration and usage, so we can save reference resolution time by skipping module attributes in `Callable`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#640](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/640) - Allow module attribute folding to be configured. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

  * Allow call definition heads to resolves to themselves for consistency with Aliases of `defmodule`.
  * Generalize `Callable.callDefinitionClauseDefiner(Call)`: in addition to the current `CallDefinitionClause`, make it work for `Implementation`, `Module`, and `Protocol`.

### Bug Fixes
* [#574](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/574) - Fix copy-paste errors in `MatchOperatorInsteadOfTypeOperator` - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#579](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/579) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Subtract 1 from arity in `.beam` file when decompiling to `defmacro` calls because the Erlang function for Elixir macros has one addition argument: the first argument is the `Caller` of the macro.
  * If the name of the decompiled macro/function is an infix operator, then decompile the head as a binary operation instead of a normal prefix name as infix operators aren't valid prefix names and led to parsing errors, which was the root cause of [#575](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/575).
  * Fix IntelliJ warnings in `BeamFileImpl`
  * Remove unused `VirtualFile` argument to `BeamFileImpl#buildFileStub`.
* [#583](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/583) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Add `++`, `=~`, and `in` to `INFIX_OPERATOR_SET`.
  * Only render infix operators if arity is `2`.
  * Prefix operator decompilation: `+` and `-` are both binary and unary operators.  When a unary operator they need to be wrapped in parentheses, so that the call definition clause is parsed correctly.
* [#585](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/585) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Ignore `JFLex` jar
  * Don't check for `elixir-lang/elixr` files remove in `1.3`
  * Allow `nil` as a keyword key.  `nil` was being lexed as a potential keyword key, but NIL was missing from the token list in the keywordKey grammar rule.
* [#599](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/599) - Some SpecialForms don't work as literals as they would be interpreted as metaprogramming, so their name needs to be wrapped as an atom to `unquote`. -  [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

* [#609](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/609) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Skip `import Kernel` in `kernel.ex` to prevent stack overflow due to recursive `import`
  * Strip all outer parentheses for left type operand, so that `(+value)` can be see as `+` operator type spec.
  * Use advice from `IndexNotReadyException` documentation and check `DumbService.isDumb(Project)` before calling `StubIndex.getElements` in `Module` and `module.MultiResolve.indexNameElements`.
  * Don't `assert` that `LookupElement#getPsiElement` is not `null` in `CallDefinitionCluase.renderElement`
  * Update to `ant` `1.10.1` because `1.10.0` is no longer hosted.
* [#612](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/612) - Yeah, it sounds weird, but an `ElixirVariable` isn't necessarily a variable if it doesn't occur in a declaration context.  It could just be a no-parentheses function call in the wrong spot, so check the parent `PsiElement` to determine if `ElixirVariable` is a variable. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#614](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/614) - Highlight parameterized type head (`maybe(t)` in `@type maybe(t)`) the same as a full type definition (`maybe(t)` in `@type maybe(t) :: t | nil`) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

* [#627](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/627) - Annotations can only be applied to the single, active file, which belongs to the `referrer` `Callable`.  The `resolved` may be outside the file if it is a cross-file function or macro usage, in which case it's `TextRange` should not be highlighted because it is referring to offsets in a different file. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#634](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/634) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * `Variable` scope for `QualifiedMultipleAliases`, which occurs when qualified call occurs over a line with assignment to a tuple, such as `Qualifier.\n{:ok, value} = call()`
  * Remove call definition clauses (function or macro) completion for bare words as it had a detrimental impact on typing feedback (the editor still took input, but it wasn't rendered until the completion returned OR `ESC` was hit to cancel the completion, which became excessive once the index of call definition clauses was expanded by the decompilation of the Elixir standard library `.beam`s, so disable it.  If bare-words completion is restored.  It will either (1) need to not use the `Reference#getVariants()` API because it generates too many objects that need to be thrown away or (2) need to only complete call definition clauses that are provably in-scope from imports or other macros.
* [#636](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/636) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Both intellij-erlang and intellij-community are Apache 2.0 licensed and its the default license for Elixir projects, so seems like a good choice for `LICENSE.md`

* [#638](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/638) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * The run configurations I put together in [#504](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/504) didn't allow for the debugger to work properly: neither pause nor breakpoints had any effect, so regenerate them from the Gradle pane.
  * Check parent of `when` operation in case it's a guarded function head in `org.elixir_lang.annonator.Parameter.putParameterized(Parameter, PsiElement)`
  * Instead of highlighting call definition clauses when they are referred to, which only works if it is in the same file, highlight all function and macro declarations when the `def*` call is encountered.
  * Only increment arity for right pipe operand instead of all operands, so that left operands resolve to correct arity or as variable/parameter.
* [#662](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/662) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Override `ModuleImpl#getProject()` to prevent `StackOverflowError`.  Without overriding `#getProject()`, `IdentifierHighlighterPass` gets stuck in a loop between `getManager` and `getProject` on the target (the `ModuleImpl`) when clicking on the space between `def`s or `defmacro`s in the decompiled `.beam` files.
  * Fix source formatting
  * Skip looking for variables unless 0-arity AND no arguments
  * Highlight unresolved macros as macro calls. Anything with a do keyword or a do block will be treated like a macro call even if it can't be resolved.  No resolved is either no resolve results or an empty list
  * Implicit imports at top of file in addition to top of Module.
* [#663](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/663) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * `CallDefinitionClause` completion provider is unexpectedly invoked both when `.` is typed, but continues to be invoked after a letter is typed after the `.`; however, once the letter is typed, the letter becomes the default prefix instead, so the prefix should only be reset to `""` when it ends in `.`.
  * Disable `Callable#getVariants` unless `Unqualified` to  prevents local functions and macros being shown as completions for qualified names.
* [#651](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/651) - [@StabbyMcDuck](https://github.com/StabbyMcDuck)
  * Among many other tweaks, the String color is now green, so that Atom and String are no longer close to one another, which was the original issue in #569

### Incompatible Changes
* [#585](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/585) - Move `^^^` to its own three-operator precedence level to match `1.2`.

## v4.7.0

### Enhancements

Replace the custom "Command" input with the "Program arguments" input built into the `CommonProgramParametersPanel`. `CommonProgramParametersPanel` expects to store the "Program Arguments" in a "ProgramParameters" field, so old run configurations will lose their "Command" option value and it will be migrated to the new "ProgramParameters". - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

* [#537](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/537) - Convert `CallDefinitionClause(Call)` to `CallDefinitionClause.fromCall(Call)`, so that `null` can be returned when `CallDefinitionClause.enclosingModular(Call)` returns `null`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#539](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/539) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Use `functionName` instead of `getName` when multiresolving unqualified functions because `getName` will return the Alias when called on `defmodule`.
  * `maybeQualifiedCallToModular` returned `null` BOTH (1) if the call was unqualified OR (2) if the call was qualified, but its modular could not be resolved, so qualified calls to `.beam`-only modules, like `File.read!` returned `null` because `File` could not be resolved to a modular.  Remove `maybeqQualifiedToModular` and call `qualifiedToModular` when `myElement` is qualified.  If the modular is `null`, then return an empty `ResolveResult[]` instead of looking for unqualified matches.
  * Pass `maxScope` to `Module` reference.  `maxScope` is generally the containing file for the element, but when using `Module` to resolve `import`s, it is the `import` call's parent element, so that the resolve doesn't ricochet between the `defmodule` and its child, the `import` call until `StackOverflowError`.
* [#545](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/545) - A variable cannot be declared in update arguments, so return `LocalSearchScope.EMPTY`, the same as interpolation. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#548](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/548) - `ElixirSystemUtil.getProcessOutput` already allowed for an empty, invalid `ProcessOutput` when the `workDir` wasn't a directory, so allow it to also be `null` and return the empty `ProcessOutput`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#549](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/549) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * If a single keyword pair is used for a type spec, treat `:` as a type for `::`
  * Limit variable use scope for variables "declared" in module attributes to the module attribute because the variable can't be declared there and it is really a variable usage without declaration.

## v4.5.0

### Enhancements
* [#452](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/452) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Go To Declaration for functions and macros (only those defined in parseable-Elixir source.  References to Erlang functions or only those available in `.beam` file, such as the standard library will not resolve.)
  * Completion for functions and macros (only those defined in parseable-Elixir source.  Erlang functions and Elixir function only in compiled `.beam` file, such as the standard library will not complete.)
    * Completion uses the same presentation as Structure View, so the you can tell whether the name is a function/macro, whether it is public/private, and the Module where it is defined.
    * Completed functions/macro insert `()` after the name in preparation for Elixir 1.4 where it is an error to have bare function calls.  It also makes it more obvious that you inserted a function and not a variable.
    * Completion works for all functions when a bare identifier is used.  For a qualified identifier, only functions/macros under than Module are shown.

* [#441](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/441) - `isParameter(Call)` called `isParameter` on its parent if it wasn't a call definition clause, delegation or macro, but `isParameter(PsiElement)` immediately calls `getParent()` and does all the `instanceof` tests on the parent.  So, instead of `isParameter(Call)` calling `isParameter(PsiElement)` on its parent, it should just call it on itself, this way the check for `ElixirInterpolation` will not be skipped and there's no need to handle `ElixirInterpolatedString`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

* [#387](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/387) - Resolve aliased modules to their `alias` call, from the alias call, you can Go To Declaration for the module itself. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Code structure

* [#397](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/397) - When a aliased name is added to the module list for completion, it's unaliased name is searched for in the `AllName` index, if any nested modules are found for the unaliased name, then those nested names are aliased and also shown for completion. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

### Bug Fixes
* [#393](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/393) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * `defimpl <PROTOCOL>, for: [<TYPE>, ...]` generates multiple canonical names, which are stored in the stub index.
    * When retrieved from the `AllName` index, the `defimpl`'s Implementation will render as if only the `defimpl <PROTOCOL>, for: <TYPE>` was used for the `<TYPE>` matching the lookup name in the Goto Symbol dialog.  For example, if you search for `Tuple`, `JSX.Encoder.Tuple` will match for [`defimpl JSX.Encoder, for: for: [Tuple, PID, Port, Reference, Function, Any]`](https://github.com/talentdeficit/exjsx/blob/master/lib/jsx.ex#L152-L155).
* [#400](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/400) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Look outside Enum.map for enclosing macro call because `Ecto` defines the clauses of `__schema__(:type, ...)` using `Enum.map`, but `enclosingMacroCall` only knews to jump over enclosing macros like `for`, so a special case was added for anonymous function given to `Enum.map`.
  * Fix if-else-ordering bug where `Call` appeared before operations (which are usually `Call`s) like `Match`.
* [#401](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/401) - In `@type unquote({name, nil, []}) :: foo`, `name` will be highlighted as a type parameter even though it is not strictly the name that will appear as a type parameter. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#405](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/405) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Resolve alias nested under aliased modules to both the `alias` and `defmodule`, as resolving to only the `alias` loses the nested name, so it wasn't possible to jump to the nested name's `defmodule`.
  * Resolve aliased name to both the `alias` and the `defmodule`, so you can skip jumping to the `alias` before jumping to the `defmodule`.
* [#406](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/406) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * The generated `ElixirParser` uses the `GeneratedParserUtilBase` from `com.intellij.lang.parser`, but since that version is a synced copy, it is a snapshot of `GeneratedParserUtilBase` from the version of GrammarKit that was current when the IDE was released.  To ensure the generated parser works on all the IDEs, I copy `GeneratedParserUtilBase` from `org.intellij.grammar.parser` into `org.elixir_lang.grammar.parser` and then use that version in `ElixirParser`.  This ensures neither the IDE's version nor the version in any installed GrammarKit plugin is used.
* [#409](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/409) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Check that index name maps to an actual project element before returning it for completion as the names from `StubIndex.getInstance.getAllKeys(...)` is a superset of actual keys in the actual project [according to Peter Gromov of JetBrains](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/207930789-StubIndex-persisting-between-test-runs-leading-to-incorrect-completions).
  * Don't index `canonicalName` if it matches the literal name, as the duplicate name leads to duplicate entries in the completion lookup.
    * `canonicalNameCollection` was renamed to `canonicalNameSet` (with type changing from `Collection<String>` to `Set<String>` to match) to emphasize that the canonical names should be unique, but `canonicalNameSet` itself should still include duplicates of name for those places where only canonical names are used.
  * Use `resolvableName` for the `unaliasedName` for `MultipleAliases` Aliases, so that they complete correctly for nested modules.
  * Completion for nested modules will no longer complete with string suffixes (i.e. `SSHView`) and only complete nested Aliases (i.e. `SSH.Key`).

### Enhancements
* [#371](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/371) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

* [#378](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/378) - `enclosingMacroCall` could climb out the stab after a `do`, but not the `else` in an `if`, which is used for defined functions conditionally in [`Phoenix.Endpoint.server/0`](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/v1.2.0/lib/phoenix/endpoint.ex#L542-L548) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#380](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/380) - A lot of ppl use the doc template after already typing `@`, but the doc template starts with `@`, so it ends up inserting `@@doc ...`. The `@doc` template is the same code, but since the name starts with `@`, it doesn't insert a second `@`. Unfortunately, the template search code doesn't prompt when just typing `@`, so you end up having to type `@doc` before only one template is selected. The `@doc` template will show in the lookup as soon as `@d` is typed, but you have to select it from the list then before tabbing to accept. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#381](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/381) - Look at end of `do` instead of start for `end` completion to stop ignoring the `:` in `do: `, when `caret - 3` would land on the `o`, now all tests are meant to land on the `o`, so `do: ` won't complete with `end` incorrectly anymore. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

* [#349](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/349) - Have both `QualifiedBracketOperation` and `UnqualifiedBracketOperation` extend `BracketOperation`, so that `BracketOperation` can be used to match both when the qualification does not matter. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

  * Regenerate parser with GrammarKit 1.4.2
  * `ElixirSdkRelease` is now `Comparable`, so version checks can be done for tests to restrict them to Elixir 1.2+ for multiple alias support.
  * Resolve Multiple Aliases with unqualified Alias in tuples.
  * `canonicalName` borrows from the idea of `PsiReference#canonicalText`: an element can have both a Name (from `getName`), which is the literal name in the code, which can be renamed, and a Canonical Name, which is the name to refer to the element without need for imports or aliases.  For this change, `defimpl`, `defmodule`, and `defprotocol` will show their full module Alias for their Canonical Name.

    This change addresses the use case of Go To Declaration that should resolved to a nested `defmodule`.

  * If no known modular (Module, Implementation, Protocol, Quote, or Use) matches the call, then use Unknown, which accepts any macro with a `do` block or keyword.  This allows Go To Symbol to no error in projects using Dogma as `defrule` is now treated as Unknown instead of causing an error that the enclosing modular could not be found.

  * Use `fullyQualifiedName` instead of `getName` for `resolvableName` because `fullyQualifiedName` is needed so that qualified aliases inside of the `{ }` of a multiple alias will not have a name as `getName` is `null` for those qualified aliases because the name from `getName` has to be a literal name that can be renamed and qualified names can't be renamed.

    * Resolve references to earlier `&&` operands, which handles code that matches a variable and only uses the variable on success like [`((cwd = cwd()) && write_tmp_dir(cwd))`](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/ccf6d14e3ec2eb96090222dad6f395b5b9ab72ac/lib/elixir/lib/system.ex#L268)
    * Resolve variables from `destructure`
  * Detect bitstring segment options and don't treat them as variables.
    * Highlight bitstring segment type options as Type, the same highlight as used for `@type` names.
    * Don't generate (unresolved) references for bitstring segment options
  * Resolve `_` to only itself, no matter how many are used to reflect that it is non-binding, while `_<name>`  will resolve to `_<name>` as it does bind.
    * Add Ignored Variable to Color Settings Page
  * Reimplement module attribute renaming so that variable renaming can be implemented using a different validator for renaming (since module attribute names include the `@`).  Non-inplace renaming should also be supported, but inplace is preferred.  (There's a setting to turn off in-place renaming in JetBrains IDEs.)
  * `operation.infix.Normalized`
    * Normalizes leftOperand, operator, and rightOperand for an Infix operation that may have errors (in either operand).  If there is an error in the operand then its normalized value is `null`.
  * Keyword key type descriptions
    * Default to `"keyword key"`.
    * Detect `bind_quoted:` usage and call those `"quote bound variable"`.
  * Add interfaces to unify matching of `Matched` and `Unmatched` form of operations when the code cares about the operator
    * `And`
    * `UnaryNonNumericOperation`
  * Add `processDeclarations` to support variable and parameter resolution using `PsiTreeUtil.treeWalkUp` and `PsiScopeProcessors`

### Bug Fixes
* [#314](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/314) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Don't generate module attribute references for control attributes: Module attributes that control compilation or are predefined by the standard library: `@behaviour`, `@callback`, `@macrocallback`, `@doc`, `@moduledoc`, `@typedoc`, `@spec`, `@opaque`, `@type`, and `@typep`, should not have references because their uses are unrelated.
  * Drop requirement that there are 2 children and only require there be 1 and assume that is the Operator.
  * Don't count @(...) as a module attribute usage: Module attribute declarations are defined as `defmacro @(...)` in Kernel and that `@` should count as a function name, not a prefix for a module attribute name.
  * Allow `null` Module for Scratch File use scope
  * Default to `"call"` for Call type
  * Fix typo that had `*Two` operations using `Type` interface
  * Don't process `AccessExpression` declarations
* [#316](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/316) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Highlight `foo` in `@spec foo` as a type, which occurs while typing a new `@spec` before `::` can be typed.
  * Check if `leftOperand` is `null` even when `checkLeft` is `true` because `checkLeft` can be `true` and `leftOperand` is `null` when the `lastParent` is the operand or operation as a whole, but there is an error in the unnormalized `leftOperand` leading to the normalized `leftOperand` being `null`.
  * Check if reference is `null` before checking if it resolves to `null` when replacing module attribute usages with their value because `AtNonNumericOperation`s can have a `null` reference when they are non-referencing, like `@spec`.

* [#320](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/320) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Stab operation parameter Use Scope is the stab operation.
  * Skip over `PsiLeafElement` when looking for variables because the `PsiLeafElement` is an error.
  * In a script file where the parent of a `Match` is a `PsiFile`, the `Match` Use Scope is the rest of the file.
  * Add `=` to `Operator Signs`
  * Skip `NoParenthesesKeywords` when highlighting types, which occurs when the `::` has no proper right operand and the following one-liner function clause with `do:` is parsed as the right operand.
  * Skip `DUMMY_BLOCK` when looking for Variable, which prevents walking through errors.
  * Use `Normalized` pattern for `Prefix`, so that the operand is `null` when only the operator matches or the operand has errors.
  * Work-around Phoenix .ex templates that contain EEX: if `<%=` from EEX is detected, don't throw error when `Modular` can't be found.
  * Fix capitalization error in example text
* [#323](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/323) - Build `jps-builder` using only Java 1.6 compatible `.class`es - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * In IntelliJ 14.1, all of `openapi.jar` targets Java 1.6 (with `MAJOR.MINOR` `50.0`), but in IntelliJ 2016.1, some of `openapi.jar` targets only Java 1.8 (with `MAJOR.MINOR` `52.0`), since `jps-builders` require parts of `openapi.jar` and must target Java 1.6 even for IntelliJ 2016.1, the `52.0` `.class`es needed to be ported into `org.elixir_lang.jps.builder`, so that the `52.0` version in `openapi.jar` wouldn't be attempted to be loaded.

    This ended up being 5 classes:

    * `ExecutionException`
    * `GeneralCommandLine`
    * `ParametersList`
    * `ParamsGroup`
    * `ProcessNotCreatedException`

    Only `GeneralCommandLine` was used directly, all others are dependencies of it.

* [#283](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/283) - All function name elements act as `PsiNameIdentifier`s now even if they don't resolve, but that means they all need to support `FindUsagesProvider#getType`, which they don't, so use a placeholder of "unknown call type" for any `Call` that can't be matched and "unknown element" for anything else. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

  * Changed `NotImplementedExceptions` and (some) `assert`s to logging custom error message that include the `PsiElement` text and the containing file as an attachment.  The files make the URL too big for the error handler to put the file contents in when opening the browser with the error handler, so the issue body instead explains how to get the attachment text out of IntelliJ's "IDE Fatal Errors"

* [#263](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/263) - Ensure compatibility from 14.0 to 2016.1 - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Use `TextAttributesKey`s that aren't deprecated in 2016.1 and work back to 14.1

    All of `CodeInsightColors` is deprecated, so all constants from there had to be replaced.  Unfortunately, the recommended replacements don't have the same color as the original, so I used different `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors` constants for some.

    "Module Attribute" is now based on `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.CONSTANT` (which is purplish in Darcula) instead of the recommended `METADATA`, which is yellow.  Although module attributes don't have to be constant since they can be set to accumulate, often they are used as constants and not really as metadata, since they are just data then.  All the `metadata` uses of module attributes have a separate color.

    "Specification" is now based on `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.FUNCTION_DECLARATION`, which maintains the golden color that `CodeInsightColors.METHOD_DECLARATION_ATTRIBUTES` had.

    "Type" is now based on `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.METADATA`, which is bright yellow unlike `CodeInsightColors.ANNOTATION_ATTRIBUTE_NAME_ATTRIBUTES`, which was a bright white.

    "Type Parameter" is now based on `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.PARAMETER`, which unfortunately has no attributes associated with it, but the constant name was too good a fit not to use, so if you want the old color, you'll need to customize it yourself.

* [#272](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/272) - Fix (one cause) of `AssertionError` in `GoToSymbolContributor` when the `Modular` (`defimpl`, `demodule`, `defprotocol`, and `quote`) could not be resolved due a `def` being surrounded by a `for` comprehension, which is common in Elixir libraries as was the case for `Postgrex`: any enclosing `for` comprehension(s) will now be ignored and the next enclosing macro will be checked to see if it is a `Modular`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#273](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/273) - While typing, before `:` in keyword pairs, after the `when`, such as in `@spec foo(id) :: id when id` before finishing typing `@spec foo(id) :: id when id: String.t`, the keyword key will be properly highlighted as a Type Parameter - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#276](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/276) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Properly handle the `Infix#rightOperand` being `null` due to the Pratt Parser matching up through the operator and then ignoring the mismatched right operand, which leads to the `Infix` having only 2 elements: the left operand and the operator.
  * `@doc` and other module attributes appearing as the right operand of `@type name ::` will be ignored as it is common when adding a new type above pre-existing, documented functions.
  * Only error in `Infix#leftOperand` if there are not 2-3 children for `Infix` instead of a strict 3.

### Incompatible Changes
* [#276](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/276) - Drop support for IntelliJ 14.0 because the parser generated by Grammar Kit 1.3.0 is not compatible with the OpenAPI libraries shipped in IntelliJ 14.0.
